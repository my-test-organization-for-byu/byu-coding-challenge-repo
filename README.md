To run my code, install node js, then do npm i readline-sync wherever you've put my code. Once this is done, enter "node run-code.js" and follow the prompts.

I couldn't get creating a pull request to work properly; I haven't figured out how to create a commit that the pull request endpoint will recognize. I have code that creates commits, as well as code that will create the license on the repo, but making a pull request for some reason has still eluded me. Well, I have code that creates pull requests, but only if there are open commits that are recognized.

I decided to leave all of my code in here as well so that you can see everything I tried. I'll admit, the code is sloppy, but I thought it would be better to show everything I did.

I wish I had had more time to work on this, and I honestly think I'm not that far off from a solution, but the poor time management is on me.

I should add that I was able to get all repos (at least the public ones that I tested) and see if they had licenses or not. So I did the first part, but I didn't finish the second part/creating the pull requests.
